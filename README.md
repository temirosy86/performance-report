Showcasing my Sales Performance Dashboard

It's my pleasure to share a data analytics project I've been working on recently: a Superstore sales performance dashboard created using Excel.

This project demonstrates my ability to clean and analyze data, generating actionable insights through interactive data visualization.

Key discoveries include:

â€¢ ðŸ’° Total Sales Insights: A comprehensive breakdown of sales by region, state, and customer segment, identifying top-performing areas.

â€¢ ðŸ“‰ Monthly Sales Trends: Analysis of seasonal patterns to inform business decisions.

â€¢ðŸ’¹ Year-Over-Year Analysis: Visualization of business growth over time.

â€¢	Revenue Distribution: Insights into sales percentages across product categories.

â€¢	Product Performance: Identification of top-performing products.

To develop this dashboard, I utilized multiple visualization types including column charts, line charts, pie charts, bar charts, and maps.

I also implemented interactive slicers for filtering by order year, customer segment, product category, and region to enable deeper analysis.
This project helped me discover the importance of data storytelling while enhancing my skills in developing interactive visualizations that create actionable insights for decision-making.
